# 🎄 Christmas Gift — 2025

This project is a small Christmas gift I created for my girlfriend. She really loves **Chang Kang Kung**, so I wanted to make something that feels personal and meaningful.

For me, Christmas is not only a holiday —  
it marks the **beginning of our relationship**, and a moment I want us to remember.

This gift is a reminder that love grows from small things, and I hope this becomes one of our warm memories together. ❤️
